## Register a custom element {#register-element}


To register a custom element, use the `Polymer` function, and pass in the
prototype for the new element. The prototype must have an `is` property that
specifies the HTML tag name for your custom element.

By specification, the custom element's name **must contain a dash (-)**. 

Example:

    // register an element
    MyElement = Polymer({

      is: 'my-element',

      // See below for lifecycle callbacks
      created: function() {
        this.textContent = 'My element!';
      }

    });

    // create an instance with createElement:
    var el1 = document.createElement('my-element');

    // ... or with the constructor:
    var el2 = new MyElement();

The `Polymer` function registers the element with the browser and returns a
constructor that can be used to create new instances of your element via code.

The `Polymer` function sets up the prototype chain for your custom element,
chaining it to the {{site.project_title}} `Base` prototype (which provides
{{site.project_title}} value-added features), so you cannot set up your own
prototype chain. However, you can use [behaviors](#prototype-mixins) to
share code between elements.

### Define a custom constructor {#custom-constructor}

The `Polymer` method returns a basic constructor that can be used to
instantiate the custom element. If you want to 
pass arguments to the constructor to configure the new element, you can 
specify a custom `factoryImpl` function on the prototype.

The constructor returned from `Polymer` creates an instance using 
`document.createElement`, then invokes the user-supplied `factoryImpl` function 
with `this` bound to the element instance. Any arguments passed to the actual
constructor are passed on to the `factoryImpl` function.

Example:

    MyElement = Polymer({

      is: 'my-element',

      factoryImpl: function(foo, bar) {
        this.foo = foo;
        this.configureWithBar(bar);
      },

      configureWithBar: function(bar) {
        ...
      }

    });

    var el = new MyElement(42, 'octopus');


Two notes about the custom constructor:

*   The `factoryImpl` method is _only_ invoked when you create an element using the 
    constructor. The `factoryImpl` method is not called if the element is created 
    from markup by the HTML parser, or if the element is created using `document.createElement`. 

*   The `factoryImpl` method is called **after** the element is initialized (local DOM 
    created, default values set, and so on). See
    [Ready callback and element initialization](#ready-method) for more information.

### Extend native HTML elements {#type-extension}

Polymer currently only supports extending native HTML elements (for example,
`input`, or `button`, as opposed to extending other custom elements, which will
be supported in a future release). These native element extensions are called
_type extension custom elements_.

To extend a native HTML element, set the `extends` property on your prototype to 
the tag name of the element to extend.


Example:

    MyInput = Polymer({

      is: 'my-input',

      extends: 'input',

      created: function() {
        this.style.border = '1px solid red';
      }

    });

    var el1 = new MyInput();
    console.log(el1 instanceof HTMLInputElement); // true

    var el2 = document.createElement('input', 'my-input');
    console.log(el2 instanceof HTMLInputElement); // true

To use a type-extension element in markup, use the _native_ tag and add an
`is` attribute that specifies the extension type name:

    <input is="my-input">

<!-- legacy anchor -->
<a id="basic-callbacks"></a>

### Define an element in the main HTML document {#main-document-definitions}

**Note:** You should only define elements from the main document when 
experimenting. In production, elements should always be defined in 
separate files and imported into your main document. 
{: .alert .alert-info }

To define an element in your main HTML document, define the element
from `HTMLImports.whenReady(callback)`. `callback` is invoked when 
all imports in the document have finished loading.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js">
        </script>
        <link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
        <title>Defining a Polymer Element from the Main Document</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <dom-module id="main-document-element">
          <template>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm a Polymer element that was defined in the
              main document!
            </p>
          </template>
          <script>
            HTMLImports.whenReady(function () {
              Polymer({
                is: 'main-document-element'
              });
            });
          </script>
        </dom-module>
        <main-document-element></main-document-element>
      </body>
    </html>

## Lifecycle callbacks {#lifecycle-callbacks}

Polymer's Base prototype implements the standard Custom Element lifecycle
callbacks to perform tasks necessary for Polymer's built-in features.  The hooks
in turn call shorter-named lifecycle methods on your prototype.

- `created` instead of `createdCallback`
- `attached` instead of `attachedCallback`
- `detached` instead of `detachedCallback`
- `attributeChanged` instead of `attributeChangedCallback`

You can fallback to using the low-level methods if you prefer (in other
words, you can simply implement `createdCallback` in your prototype).

Polymer adds an extra callback, `ready`, which is invoked when Polymer has
finished creating and initializing the element's local DOM.


Example:

    MyElement = Polymer({

      is: 'my-element',

      created: function() {
        console.log(this.localName + '#' + this.id + ' was created');
      },

      attached: function() {
        console.log(this.localName + '#' + this.id + ' was attached');
      },

      detached: function() {
        console.log(this.localName + '#' + this.id + ' was detached');
      },

      attributeChanged: function(name, type) {
        console.log(this.localName + '#' + this.id + ' attribute ' + name +
          ' was changed to ' + this.getAttribute(name));
      }

    });

### Ready callback and local DOM initialization {#ready-method} 

The `ready` callback is called when an element's local DOM is ready.

It is called after the element's template has been stamped and all elements
**inside the element's local DOM** have been configured (with values bound from
parents, deserialized attributes, or else default values) and had their `ready`
method called. 

Implement `ready` when it's necessary to manipulate an element's
local DOM when the element is constructed.

    ready: function() {
      // access a local DOM element by ID using this.$
      this.$.header.textContent = 'Hello!';
    }

**Note:** This example uses [Automatic node finding](local-dom.html#node-finding) to
access a local DOM element. 
{: .alert .alert-info }

Within a given tree, `ready` is generally called in _document order_, but you should not
rely on the ordering of initialization callbacks between sibling elements, or between 
a host element and its light DOM children.


### Initialization order {#initialization-order}

The element's basic initialization order is:

- `created` callback  
- local DOM initialized 
- `ready` callback
- [`factoryImpl` callback](#custom-constructor)
- `attached` callback

Note that the **initialization order may vary** depending on whether or not the
browser includes native support for web components. In particular, there are no
guarantees with regard to initialization timing between **sibling elements** or
between **parents and light DOM children**. You should not rely on observed
timing to be identical across browsers, except as noted below.

For a given element:

*   The `created` callback is always called before `ready`.
*   The `ready` callback is always called before `attached`.
*   The `ready` callback is called on any **local DOM children** before it's called
    on the host element.

This means that an element's **light DOM children** may be initialized **before or after** 
the parent element, and an element's **siblings may become `ready` in any order**.

For accessing sibling elements when an element initializes, you can call `async` from inside
the `attached` callback:

    attached: function() {
       this.async(function() {
          // access sibling or parent elements here
       });
    }

### Registration callback

`Polymer.Base` also implements `registerCallback`, which is called by `Polymer()` 
to allow `Polymer.Base` to supply a [layering system](experimental.html#feature-layering) 
for Polymer features.


## Static attributes on host {#host-attributes}

If a custom element needs HTML attributes set on it at create-time, the attributes may
be declared in a `hostAttributes` property on the prototype, where keys are the
attribute names and values are the values to be assigned.  Values should
typically be provided as strings, as HTML attributes can only be strings;
however, the standard `serialize` method is used to convert values to strings,
so `true` will serialize to an empty attribute, and `false` will result in no
attribute set, and so forth (see [Attribute serialization](properties.html#attribute-serialization) for more
details).

Example:

    <script>

      Polymer({

        is: 'x-custom',

        hostAttributes: {
          'string-attribute': 'Value',
          'boolean-attribute': true,
          tabindex: 0
        }

      });

    </script>

Results in:

    <x-custom string-attribute="Value" boolean-attribute tabindex="0"></x-custom>

**Note:** The `class` attribute can't be configured using `hostAttributes`.
{: .alert .alert-error }

## Behaviors {#prototype-mixins}

Elements can share code in the form of _behaviors_, which can define 
properties, lifecycle callbacks, event listeners, and other features.

For more information, see [Behaviors](behaviors.html).

## Class-style constructor {#element-constructor}

If you want to set up your custom element's prototype chain but **not** register
it immediately, you can use the  `Polymer.Class` function. `Polymer.Class` takes
the same prototype argument as the `Polymer` function,  and sets up the
prototype chain, but does _not_ register the element. Instead it  returns a
constructor  that can be passed to `document.registerElement` to register your
element with the browser, and after  which can be used to instantiate new
instances of your element via code.

If you want to define and register the custom element in one step, use the 
[`Polymer` function](#register-element).

Example:

    var MyElement = Polymer.Class({

      is: 'my-element',

      // See below for lifecycle callbacks
      created: function() {
        this.textContent = 'My element!';
      }

    });

    document.registerElement('my-element', MyElement);

    // Equivalent:
    var el1 = new MyElement();
    var el2 = document.createElement('my-element');

`Polymer.Class` is designed to provide similar ergonomics to a speculative future
where an ES6 class may be defined and provided to `document.registerElement`.
